# HissingChameleon
Silly discord bot for dumb things.

Everyone's got their own discord bot. Here's mine.


# On Heroku, add these buildpacks
- https://github.com/jonathanong/heroku-buildpack-ffmpeg-latest.git
- https://github.com/xrisk/heroku-opus.git

### Note: I stopped using Heroku for 2 main reasons: youtube-dl doesn't work so well there, and more importantly, Heroku will be discontinuing its free tier soon.


# TODO

* Need to figure out why PyAutoGUI (and the various other input libraries) are not sending input to Retroarch
* Refactor the documentation because 'discord-pretty-help' will make it look nice in the chat
* General refactoring, some stuff can be further de-coupled
    * It's not *terrible* but it could be better
* More color format support would be nice
    * I think python has support for color conversion, or its getting it
